note: don't try hard to find a matching ontology/term on the first time. use the mamespace http://rdf.lodgeit.net.au/misc or whatever, just mint your own, and align later.



question then is if we want to link to, let's say the github page where dev_runner.pl can be seen, or we want to mint a new resource for it, ie <http://rdf.lodgeit.net.au/sw_dev/dev_runner.pl>. And if we want to treat the github link as a resource, ie, attach additional properties to it later. Minting a new resource is the more future-proof way, for one.
